</div>

<p>The present study is one of origins. Our object is to trace
from the beginning the gradual development of the Declaration
of the Rights of Man, of the first written constitution in France,
and to follow the movement which led to the abolition of monarchy
and to the adoption of the republican form of government.
In view of the complex phenomena of the French Revolutionary
period, it is advantageous to our understanding of that surpassingly
interesting era to view the various classes of facts from
different standpoints. The Revolution was social, religious, political,
and economic. While the study of any one of these phases
necessarily involves the others, the best results will be secured
by considering the movement now as social, now as religious, now
as political, and now as economic. This paper is an investigation
of the early Revolution from the political point of view. Whence
arose in the minds of the French the idea of a Declaration of the
Rights of Man? Where did they derive the principles therein
contained? How were they led to feel the need of a written constitution?
Through what series of events were they brought to
suspect, to denounce and to renounce royalty, and to accept the
idea of an elective executive? Such questions as these are of interest
to the student of political history.</p>

<p>Though the primary sources for the investigation of this subject
are limited in our American libraries, enough has been found to
lead to an interpretation suggestive and, we believe, correct.</p>

<p>Recently two important books upon the French Revolution
have appeared. M. A. Aulard published last year his <i>Histoire
politique de la Révolution française</i>. In this work he has reexamined,
in the light of the voluminous material at hand in
France, these same questions. Prof. William M. Sloane, of Columbia
University, has treated the Revolution primarily in its
ecclesiastical aspects in his <i>French Revolution and Religious Reform</i>.
The manuscript of this thesis was practically completed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
before either of these works came into the writer’s hands. It did
not seem advisable, therefore, to make any modifications in the
conclusions herein reached; they are, however, in the main in
accord with those arrived at by these two authors. The Declaration
of the Rights of Man and the origin of the idea of a written
constitution are here more fully discussed than by these writers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DECLARATION_OF_THE_RIGHTS_OF_MAN">THE DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN.</h2>

</div>

<p>The first question that naturally suggests itself in studying
the Declaration of the Rights of Man is, whence did the French
derive the idea of such an instrument? It has been asserted, and
an attempt has been made to prove, that both the notion of
such a Declaration and its content were borrowed from the early
American State Constitutions.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This question, however, really
resolves itself into a double inquiry, <i>i. e.</i>, whence did the French
receive their notion of the guaranty of individual rights against
governmental intrusion, and how far did the ideas contained in
the Declaration of the Rights of Man represent the political traditions
and current thought of France? Only a study of the abuses
and of the political theories of pre-revolutionary France and of
the facts relative to this document, as they are revealed in the
writings of contemporaries and in the records of the Constituent
Assembly, can at all satisfactorily answer these inquiries.</p>

<p>The sympathetic relation between France and the colonies
during and after the American Revolution, the interest in America
of some of the more radical French political theorists, such as
Mably and Condorcet, and the community of ideas existing between
the two countries, shown by the Jeffersonian school in
America, and by the publication of American writings in France,
are facts well known. Hence it may be inferred that, when a few
of the cahiers asked for a Declaration, their framers were acquainted
with and influenced by the American Bills of Rights.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
But not until the States General had assumed the rôle of a Constitutional
Convention were the proposals of Declarations numerous.
Then it was that the Frenchmen gave abundant proof of
their fondness for formulating political documents.</p>

<p>On July 9, 1789, M. Mounier, who had been charged by the
Constituent Assembly with the preparation of a scheme for a constitution,
presented a report in behalf of the committee, the first
article of which reads: “Tout gouvernement doit avoir pour unique
but le maintien des droits des hommes; d’où il suit que pour rappeller
constamment le gouvernement au but proposé, la constitution
doit commencer par la déclaration des droits naturels et imprescriptibles
de l’homme.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> July 11, Lafayette proposed the
form of a Declaration of Rights, containing twelve articles, and
pointed out the advantages of such an instrument.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> M. Lally
Tollendal approved this project, but argued that it was dangerous
to adopt any such articles separate from the Constitution; he at the
same time called the attention of the Assembly to the great difference
between a new-born colonial people, who were breaking with
a distant government, and an old nation extending over an immense
territory, one of the first nations of the world, which for
eight centuries had obeyed the same dynasty and had cherished
the royal power when it had been tempered by custom. This
nation, he said, will idolize this power when it shall be regulated
by laws.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> M. Lally Tollendal certainly believed that they were
following the American example.</p>

<p>July 14, Lafayette’s motion was discussed. Some thought the
Declaration should be put at the head of the Constitution, in order
permanently to secure the rights of man before establishing those
of society; others thought it should be placed after the Constitution.
It was decided at this session that the Constitution
should contain a Declaration, but its position was left for later
decision.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Siéyès read his exposition of the Rights of Man, on
July 10, to the Constitutional Committee, and on July 21, to the
Assembly.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> On July 17, M. Target presented a scheme of thirty-one
articles for a Declaration, and M. Mounier one of sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
articles.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> On July 31, M. D. Servan, advocate to the Parlement
of Grenoble, presented a project of thirteen articles. August 1,
a long debate occurred upon the position to be given to the Declaration
in the Constitution. M. Thouret also offered a scheme for
a Declaration. The debate continued. On August 4, M. Camus
proposed that the Assembly make a declaration of the rights and
duties of man and of a citizen; but this motion was defeated by a
vote of 570 to 433.[9] However, at the same session, it was decided
almost unanimously that the Constitution should be preceded by
the Declaration. On August 12, Abbé Siéyès offered a project of
a Declaration of forty-two articles.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>During discussion in the Assembly, August 1, M. Champion de
Cicé, Bishop of Auxerre, opposed a declaration as useless at that
time, and said that the example of North America was not conclusive,
as that country only contains proprietors, cultivators, and
citizens all on the same social footing. M. De la Luzerne, Bishop
of Langres, also asserted that the Constitution of an empire did
not need a Declaration. M. Malouet, in making strong protest
against their placing the Declaration at the head of the Constitution,
portrayed the contrast between the situation of France and
that of America.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> M. Delandine spoke in agreement with M.
Malouet.</p>

<p>On August 12, two projects for a Declaration of Rights were
offered to the Assembly: one of seventy-one articles, by Gonges-Carton
of Quercy, and one of twenty-four articles, by the Sixth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Bureau of the Assembly. On August 13, a committee of five,
consisting of Desmeuniers, Bishop of Langres, M. Tronchet,
Count Mirabeau and M. Rhédon, was chosen to receive the drafts
of a Constitution and to recast these into one form.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> August 14,
Mirabeau, on behalf of the committee, reported a scheme of a
Declaration containing nineteen articles. In speaking of the aim
of the committee, he said, that from the score of plans offered
them, they had sought, like the Americans, to construct a Declaration
not of abstract and scientific principles, but one of political
truths that would readily be comprehended by the popular mind.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
In the debate of August 18 upon the Declaration, M. Rabaud
de Saint Étienne said that the Declaration of Rights had been
adopted because the <i>cahiers</i> had asked it, and that the <i>cahiers</i> had
asked it because the Americans had set the example, but that this
was no reason why the Declarations should be similar, for the
circumstances of the two nations were different.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>August 19, the Assembly decided to discuss first the Declaration
of the Sixth Bureau.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> On August 21, after some debate, the
Assembly adopted the preamble of the plan, somewhat modified,
presented by the committee of five. M. Mounier then proposed
three articles, which were adopted. August 21, on the proposal
of M. Alexander de Lameth, articles four, five, and six, after discussion,
were adopted.</p>

<p>August 21, M. de Boislander proposed a plan of seventy-four
articles. August 22, after divers proposals had been made and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
discussed, articles seven, eight, and nine were adopted.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> August
23, after many proposals and lengthy debate, article ten was
agreed upon. August 24, a liberal discussion of the phraseology
resulted in the adoption of articles eleven, twelve, and thirteen.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
August 26, after some discussion, articles fourteen and fifteen
were accepted; later in the same day, articles sixteen and seventeen
were agreed upon.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Then the Assembly resolved that the
consideration of further articles should be postponed until the
Constitution should be completed.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> October 2, the articles previously
adopted were presented to the Assembly, with article four
changed from “La liberté consiste à faire tout ce qui ne nuit pas à
autrui,” to “La liberté consiste à pouvoir faire tout” etc. The
change was accepted. The whole Constitution was presented to
the king September 13, 1791, and accepted by him. In the Assembly,
September 14, the king swore to obey the constitution.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>These are the facts of historical data relating to the formation
of the Declaration of the Rights of Man purposely set forth in
detail and in chronological order. What conclusions may we
draw from them? The frequent reference to the American Bill
of Rights, the number of Declarations proposed in <i>cahiers</i> and
before the Assembly, differing in form and in length, but agreeing
in fundamental principles, the discussions, the selections and the
modifications to which this raw material was subjected in the
process of constructing the Declaration finally adopted, warrant
these two inferences: (1) the notion of a Declaration of Rights,
separate from the Constitution proper, was suggested to the
French by the American State Constitutions; (2) the contents of
the articles and the language in which they were couched were
original.</p>

<p>A study of the separate articles of the Declaration in the light
of contemporary conditions gives additional reason for thinking
that the ideas therein contained were not foreign to France. For
convenience of consideration in the present study, the articles of
the Declaration may be divided into two classes: the first class
consists of those articles that were in the main reactive against
certain abuses under which the French suffered; the second class<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
comprises those articles which contained principles more especially
theoretical. Less proof, perhaps, is necessary for deciding
upon the originality of the former class than upon that of the
latter. We shall treat these classes in the order named.</p>

<p>“Art. 7. No person shall be accused, arrested or imprisoned
except in the cases and according to the forms prescribed by law.
Any one soliciting, transmitting, executing, or causing to be executed
any arbitrary order shall be punished. But any citizen
summoned or arrested in virtue of the law shall submit without
delay, as resistance constitutes an offense.</p>

<p>“Art. 8. The law shall provide for such punishments only as are
strictly and obviously necessary, and no one shall suffer punishment
except it be legally inflicted in virtue of a law, passed and
promulgated before the commission of the offence.</p>

<p>“Art. 9. As all persons are held innocent until they shall have
been declared guilty, if arrest shall be deemed indispensable, all
severity not essential to the securing of the prisoner’s person shall
be severely repressed by law.”</p>

<p>That these three articles were aimed at no imaginary or very
distant wrongs is evident from a cursory survey of the administration
of the laws of France, and from the protests of French
authors. <i>Lettres de cachet</i>, arbitrary imprisonments, retroactive
laws, and cruelly exaggerated penalties were not uncommon.
Mirabeau and Voltaire had both suffered under arbitrary laws and
had painted the injustice of such laws in lurid colors. Mirabeau’s
<i>Lettres de cachet</i> and his <i>Essai sur le despotisme</i> bristle with protests
against the abuses of the old <i>régime</i>. The following gruesome
picture is a suggestive statement of the way in which justice
was administered in France in the eighteenth century:</p>

<p>“The disproportion of crimes and of penalties was flagrant. A
house thief was hung in 1733; an ecclesiastic, guilty of having
found fault with the expulsion of the Jesuits, was also hung in
1762. The procedure was unjust and inhuman. The accused,
assumed to be guilty in advance, ignorant of the crime with which
he was charged, without counsellor or advocate, interrogated <i>à
huis clos</i>, submitted to the preparatory question, was judged
secretly. Once condemned, he was tortured before undergoing
his punishment. And what punishment! For imprisonment,
transportation or hanging was in vogue. The burning at the
stake had fallen into desuetude, but the lash, branding with red-hot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
iron, the galleys, quartering, the rack, still did their savage
work.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Protests against these enormities were raised by the philosophers,
and later by enlightened magistrates, such as Montesquieu,
Servan, Linguet, and Malesherbes. In 1780, the “preparatory
question” was abolished.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Mirabeau, in denouncing retroactive laws, says: “Nulle puissance
humaine, ni surhumaine ne peut justifier l’effet rétroactif
d’aucune loi.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>“Art. 10. No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions,
including his religious views, provided their manifestation does
not disturb the public order established by law.”</p>

<p>Since the sixteenth century, France had been wrestling with the
problem of how to adjust two hostile faiths to each other. Farther
to complicate the matter, a schism occurred in the seventeenth
century within the Catholic Church, which aroused between
Jesuits and the Jansenists a feeling of intolerance, well-nigh
as violent and determined as that which already existed
between the Catholics and the Huguenots. Even in the eighteenth
century intolerance, held in partial abeyance, frequently
broke out in overt acts, which displayed the vindictiveness of
the hostile parties. The philosophers, more interested in humanity
than in the prejudices of any faction, championed in the name
of tolerance the party persecuted. The new spirit gained support.
The writings of the latter half of the eighteenth century
abound with denunciations of intolerance and with pleas for
tolerance.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> By and by the movement was fruitful, and on January<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
19, 1788, the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris registered a decree giving civil
rights to Protestants.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>“Art. 11. The free communication of ideas and opinions is one
of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may,
accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be
responsible for the abuse of this freedom as shall be defined by
law.”</p>

<p>Here too is an attempt to secure permanently that for which a
long struggle had taken place. Two powers, the Church and
Royalty, had labored, now singly and now together, to regulate
the expression of ideas. The writing and the writer had been
equally the object of royal inclemency—the one being consigned
to the flames, the other to prison. But in spite of royal decrees,
public sentiment gravitated towards liberty of expression. In
1776, Malesherbes secured the opening of the prisons of Vincennes
and the Bastille for the release of prisoners held under <i>Lettres de
cachet</i>.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Again, in 1784, in response to Mirabeau’s “<i>Lettres de
cachet</i>,” the dungeons of Vincennes were opened.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>“Art. 12. The security of the rights of man and of the citizen
requires a public <i>force</i>. This <i>force</i> is, therefore, established for
the good of all and not for the personal advantage of those to
whom it shall be entrusted.”</p>

<p>This twelfth article was at the same time the expression of a
political theory and reactionary against past practices. It was
the theory of the framers of the Declaration of the Rights of Man
that the nation was supreme, the monarch only an hereditary
administrative agent. To maintain this status, the power of military
force must be employed only for the advantage of the nation.
d’Argenson, in 1754, had complained that “Le roi n’emploie
plus ses forces que contre ses sujets.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In 1771, when the obstinate
<i>parlement</i> had been replaced by the <i>Grand Conseil</i>, troops were
used to guard this substitute which was designated “Maupeou’s
parlement,” and the people considered the whole procedure as
contrary to the French Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Mirabeau had also denounced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
the royal army in these plain words: “Je dis que les
troupes réglées sont l’instrument du despotisme, comme leur institution
en fut le signal. L’exemple de nos voisins n’est pas une
preuve contradictoire; et ne voit on pas en effet que toute constitution
en Europe est dégénérée en arbitraire et s’accélère vers le
despotisme; Les troupes réglées ont été et seront toujours le fléau
de la liberté; mais ce fléau est intolérable quand il devient le
rempart des déprédations.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The people in several of the <i>cahiers</i> manifested fear lest the
monarch might endanger, by the use of an army, the national
rights, and consequently asked for the dismissal of foreign troops,
for a new constitution for the army, and for the destruction of internal
forts.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>“Art. 13. A common contribution is essential for the maintenance
of the public forces and for the cost of administration. This
should be equitably distributed among all the citizens in proportion
to their means.”</p>

<p>The inequality of taxes was, in France, an abuse recognized
and condemned for centuries. Bodin, in his <i>République</i>, written
in the sixteenth century, criticised the exemption of the clergy
and of the nobility.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Already under Louis XIII., throughout two-thirds
of France, where the <i>taille</i> was a personal tax, 2,000,000 of
richer persons were exempt from the <i>taille</i>, while 8,000,000 were
taxable. D’Avenel says that the workmen paid under Louis
XIII. four and a half times as much as to-day, though they earned
much less.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The grievous exemptions continued so that the
Third Estate during the eighteenth century supported the chief
burden of royal taxes and was subjected to onerous feudal dues
besides.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>The Physiocrats advocated as a remedy for this injustice a system
which should make the taxes proportionate to each one’s
productive riches. Turgot, taking the first step towards the
realization of this idea, said, in defense of his proposal for the
abolition of <i>corvées</i>, February, 1776: “The expenses of government
having for their object the interest of all, all should contribute
to them; and the more one enjoys the advantages of society,
the more one should regard himself honored in sharing the expenses.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
But his efforts were vain; for the privileged classes
esteemed their exemptions too highly to submit tamely to a burdensome
reform; hence they stubbornly persisted in their resistance
to innovations in the customary methods of collecting taxes.
Nevertheless there was a growing sentiment in favor of reform;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
so that when the <i>cahiers</i> of 1789 were prepared, the majority of
those of the higher orders acceded to an equal partition in the
burdens of the fisc.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>“Art. 14. All the citizens have a right to decide, either personally
or by their representatives, upon the necessity of the public
contribution; to grant this freely; to know to what uses it is put,
and to fix the proportion, the mode of assessment and of collection,
and the duration of the taxes.”</p>

<p>The French monarch, as in other European countries, from the
time that the royal domains were found insufficient to meet the
governmental expenses, was engaged in a continual struggle with
the nation over the right to grant subsidies. The nation asserted
only sporadically and incoherently its right to vote these supplies.
For the French did not manifest that persistent and determined
resistance to appropriations, unrequited by redress of political
grievances, which their English neighbors exhibited so often
and in such a marked degree. Nevertheless, during a minority
or under a weak monarch, when able popular leaders flourished,
the cause of the people was more stubbornly maintained. The
States General claimed this guardianship in earlier days; but in
the two centuries previous to the Revolution it was the <i>Parlement</i>
of Paris that contended with increasing vigor and obstinacy
against the arbitrary exactions of the king. As a final resort, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
asserted, July 30, 1787, that “le principe constitutionnel de la
monarchie française était que les impôts fussent consentis par ceux
qui devraient les supporter.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The continued and inextricable
confusion of finances was the immediate cause of the calling of the
Notables, and later of the States General. So far had the public
sentiment reacted against the actual fiscal mismanagement, that
the <i>cashier</i> were well-nigh unanimous in seeking for the nation
the right to grant subsidies.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>“Art. 15. Society has a right to require of every public agent
an account of his administration.”</p>

<p>Article 15 was both theoretical and reactionary against actual
abuses. If the nation was to be supreme over all of its agents, it
could only hope effectually to maintain that superiority by holding
all its functionaries strictly accountable. Practical experience
under the monarchy in the collection and the expenditure of
finances had impressed an effective lesson upon the French people
of the abuses incident to irresponsible officers. The <i>Cour des
Aides</i>, in its noteworthy remonstrance of 1775, reviewed the status
of the financial administration. The injustice of the <i>ferme</i>, the
arbitrariness of the bureaucracy, the complexity of the system,
the failure of popular petitions to reach the throne, and the need
of thorough reform, were clearly set forth.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Then, too, Necker,
by the publication of his <i>Compte rendu</i> (1781) and <i>L’Administration
des finances</i> (1785), had afforded the nation a glimpse of public
finances imperfect, yet in the highest degree stimulating to its
curiosity.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> As an illustration of the status of public opinion, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Notables in 1787 demanded that some report of receipts and expenses
should be published annually, and that capable men, foreign
to the administration, should be called to the <i>conseil des
finances</i> for reviewing the work.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Here, too, the <i>cahiers</i> were
practically a unit in their demands.</p>

<p>“Art. 17. Since property is an inviolable and sacred right, no
one shall be deprived thereof except where public necessity,
legally determined, shall clearly demand it, and then only on
condition that the owner shall have been previously and equitably
indemnified.”</p>

<p>Private property under the <i>ancien régime</i> was not sacred. De
Tocqueville cites the following, which may serve us for illustration
of the condition: “A royal declaration was made, suspending
in time of war repayment of all loans contracted by towns, villages,
colleges, communities, hospitals, charitable houses, trade
corporations and others, repayable out of town dues by us conceded,
though the instrument securing the said loans stipulates
for the payment of interest in the case of non-payment at the stipulated
time. Thus not only is the obligation of repayment at the
stipulated terms suspended, but the security itself is impaired.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
This article, seventeenth, was also reactive against the grievous
and burdensome <i>corvées</i>, military convoys, and forced transportation
of convicts.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The remaining seven articles are more theoretical, covering the
doctrines of liberty, equality, natural and inalienable rights,
national sovereignty, the social contract and the separation of
powers. The views expressed were, in the main, accepted at
least in theory in the American States. France was not, however,
indebted to the colonies for them; although their germinal ideas
had been introduced from the teachings of foreign writers, notably
from the English, they had grown up in France largely as a home
product.</p>

<p>The doctrine of national or popular sovereignty was no new
conception for the French nation. It had been appealed to by the
Church to check the secular power, and by the Empire to check<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
ecclesiastical encroachments. Thomas Aquinas, the oracle of the
Church, had recognized the popular will as a limitation upon the
royal power, and had commended the elective form of monarchy.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Marsilio of Padua, in his <i>Defensor Pacis</i>, was even more pronounced
in favor of popular sovereignty. “The sovereignty of
the State,” he said, “rests with the people; by it properly are the
laws made and to it they owe their validity. From the nation
itself proceeds all rights and powers, it is the authoritative lawgiver
among men.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In the sixteenth century the Calvinists and
the League alternately made use of the theory of popular sovereignty.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
This theory was revived in the eighteenth century and
popularized by Rousseau and his disciples.</p>

<p>The doctrine of natural rights has not so remote an origin for
France. De Tocqueville rightly pointed out the distinction between
liberty, regarded as “the enjoyment of a privilege” and
liberty considered as “the exercise of a universal right”; he also
showed that the Romans and the feudal aristocracy figured their
liberties to themselves under the former type; and that it was
not till the eighteenth century that the French nation began to
conceive of liberty as a natural right.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>This transformation of the theory of liberty from a privilege to
a natural right was chiefly accomplished after 1734. Boulainvilliers,
in <i>L’Histoire de l’ancien gouvernement de la France</i>, published
(1727) in Holland after his death, asserted as its fundamental
thought: “Le gouvernement féodal est le chef d’oeuvre de l’ésprit
humain.” To the author, all progress of royal, civil, or municipal
authority is an usurpation of the rights of the nobility, who were
the only heirs of the early Franks, conquerors of the Gauls.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
This champion of the feudal aristocracy was not answered in the
name of democracy, but of privileged rights. Abbé Dubois, the
secretary of the French Academy, replied in “the name of Roman
Gaul, semi-municipal and semi-monarchical.” This reply, entitled,
“<i>Histoire critique de l’établissement de la monarchie française</i>”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
(1734), denied the Frankish conquest and asserted that the
French monarchy had succeeded in a peaceable way to the rights
of the Roman Empire over the Gauls, and that the feudal system
had been established by usurpation several centuries later. Public
opinion and the judgment of the <i>savants</i>, says Martin, pronounced
in favor of Dubois.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Saint Pierre, d’Argenson, and Montesquieu contributed to the
political literature of the century, but did not formulate a new
theory of rights. The Physiocrats applied the natural law to
economic problems, but not specifically to political questions;
this was reserved for Rousseau. In the Genevan philosopher’s
writings, natural rights and kindred democratic ideas were treated
in such a popular style that they were able to revolutionize the
French political theories in a generation.</p>

<p>A critical student cannot attribute complete originality to
Rousseau; the similarity of his views to those of Locke is too
striking. He borrowed from his English predecessor psychological,
philosophical and political conceptions.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The <i>Contrat Social</i>
(1762), however, according with the nascent political <i>Zeit-Geist</i> of
France, found conditions favorable to the ready acceptance of its
ideas. The philosophers had shaken the authority of dogma,
humanitarian views were gaining prominence, men were tired of
arbitrary imprisonments and of useless privileges, moreover, the
long struggle between the monarch and the <i>parlements</i> was still
unsettled, the theory of the right of <i>parlement</i> to refuse to record
decrees was found to need a firmer basis than custom. The sympathies
of even the nobles were awakened in behalf of the peasants
and the curates. The Physiocrats hoped for tax reform, to
be effected by a strong sovereign, though, when attempted by
Turgot, it had failed. Amid such conditions the <i>Contrat Social</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
was being read. Its striking, stimulating apothegms furnished
apt quotations. Its effect was revolutionary. Even philosophers
and magistrates were not insensible to its stimulus.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> When the
nation was called to speak, on the eve of the Estates General, in
pamphlets and in <i>cahiers</i>, the influence of Rousseau was patent.
The speeches made in the National Assembly were constantly
interlarded with quotations and ideas from <i>Contrat Social</i>.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>After this general introduction to the political theories of the
Revolution, we are ready to examine the remaining articles of the
Declaration of the Rights of Man. We shall place in parallel
with these some quotations from the <i>Contrat Social</i> that will serve
to indicate the similarity of their ideas.</p>

<p>The Physiocrats also had, in a measure, advocated these principles.
Both Quesnay and Turgot expressed themselves unequivocally
for the protection of private property.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Let it be asserted
with the strongest emphasis that these six articles were not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
merely the expression of theories. They had an intensely practical
genesis, for they were the slowly-matured product of a reaction
against a long-felt vexatious regime. That regime had interfered
with private property and with individual action in such
ways as to be grievous, yes, intensely grievous to the people.</p>

<p>“Art. 16. A society in which the observance of the law is not
assured, nor the separation of powers defined, has no constitution
at all.”</p>

<p>The theory of the separation of powers was one idea taught by
Montesquieu<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> that had been gradually accepted by his countrymen.
He was studied by the would-be-publicists of the Revolutionary
era, and much stress was put upon this constitutional
principle. The Constitution which they formed is the best example
of the thorough application of this impracticable doctrine.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>In this discussion we have shown that while the suggestion of
a Declaration of Rights came from the early American State Constitutions,
its content was French. Its internal resemblance to
the American instruments is attributable to the fact that the
abuses to be feared and the recognized political theories were the
same in both countries. In truth, France had greater reason to
apprehend the return of the long-endured abuses, from which she
was even then endeavoring to extricate herself, than had America.
Likewise the fact that each country had derived its democratic
views from a common source—the teachings of the English
Puritans—largely explains the identity of the existing political
theories.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CONSTITUTION">CONSTITUTION.</h2>

</div>

<p>The States-General which met at Versailles, May 5, 1789, assumed
in the following June the name of National Assembly, and
undertook the formulation of a written constitution. According
to the current views, this epochal transformation was either a
political freak of an old monarchy, newly leavened with democratic
ideas, or a manifestation of the rare phenomenon of a
nation’s being carried sympathetically in the wake of a distant
and new-born republic. But a careful consideration of the events,
institutions, and conditions of France previous to the action of the
National Assembly proves conclusively that the traditional interpretations
are not correct.</p>

<p>It is foreign to the province of the present paper to explore
minutely the shadowy historical region, whence arose the political
institutions of monarchical France, or to analyze exhaustively
those institutions themselves. It is sufficient to note that already
at the beginning of the XVII. century there had developed certain
institutions with a normal mode of procedure, that may justly
be called a constitution, not embraced in written documents, but
one implied in the institutions and usages. The leading features
of that constituted government were four: the King, the States-General,
the <i>Conseil d’État</i> and the <i>Parlements</i>.</p>

<p>The king was not only the executive, but the initiator of laws,
and the source of justice.</p>

<p>The States-General, judged by precedents, was an advisory
body to the king, about which there existed much uncertainty as
to its composition, its powers and its period of assembling. It
was dependent upon the monarch for convocation, and for the
promulgation of the results of its deliberations.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Conseil d’État</i>, composed of the nobility, was, in a narrower
sense, the permanent advisory council of the king. In this body
the laws originated, and under its supervision the administration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
was accomplished. It also had judicial functions, being superior
to the <i>Parlement</i> as a <i>cour de cassation</i> in civil cases.</p>

<p>The duties of the <i>Parlements</i> were primarily judicial, but in
addition the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris possessed legislative functions,
inasmuch as the laws were sent to it for registration. The <i>Parlement</i>
by custom had come to make use of remonstrances to the
king in case of laws distasteful to them. Though some monarchs,
as Louis XI., XII., and Henry IV., had paid some regard to these
remonstrances,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> yet even in the sixteenth century the remonstrance
did not stop the determined monarch, but the court was forced to
yield to the royal wish in the <i>lit de justice</i>.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> There existed, therefore,
a singular balance of power between the <i>Conseil d’État</i> and
the <i>Parlement</i>. The <i>Conseil d’État</i>, as a <i>cour de cassation</i>, might
annul the parliamentary remonstrance, and, inversely, the <i>Parlement</i>
might, in virtue of its power to register, check the laws originating
from the <i>Conseil d’État</i>. It is worthy of remark, however,
that even at this period, this normal distribution of functions was
not so balanced and guarded as to avoid abnormal procedure.
Neither the <i>States General</i> nor the <i>Parlement</i> was put wholly beyond
the control of the executive.</p>

<p>D’Avenel, expressing a view not uncommon in the earlier days
of the Revolution of 1789, asserts in his remarkable book, <i>Richelieu
et la monarchie absolue</i>, that France had a constitution before the
ministry of the politic Richelieu, yet not thereafter,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> but it is difficult
to defend such a declaration. It may be admitted that the
States-General were no longer convoked after 1614, that the <i>personnel</i>
of the nobility was altered, that the <i>Parlement</i> was now and
then forced into acquiescence to the royal will; nevertheless the
two bodies, the <i>Conseil d’État</i> and the <i>Parlement</i>, continued to
function very nearly as before, and at times the <i>Parlement</i> emerged
from its submissiveness and haughtily asserted its pretensions.</p>

<p>In a series of conflicts between the court and the <i>Parlement</i>,
into which we have not space to go exhaustively, the idea of fundamental
or constitutional laws, of which the <i>Parlement</i> declared
itself the guardian, was repeatedly asserted; in the later period of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
this constitutional struggle, partly from the inability of the <i>Parlement</i>
to maintain its pretensions and partly from the development
of the ideas of natural rights, of the rights of the people and of
the rights of the nation, the desire for some more distinct definition
of the power of the executive and the rights of the nation
became manifest. The <i>Parlement</i>, composed of an aristocracy
whose office was an hereditary possession, was naturally alert
to extend its political influence; this extension of necessity
brought it into conflict with the absolutism of the monarch.
When a vigorous monarch, or skillful, energetic minister was at
the head of affairs, the <i>Parlement</i> was driven to humble obedience;
but where there was a regency, a weak monarch, or a crisis,
financial or administrative, the legal aristocracy reasserted and
extended their pretensions. By a decree of February 21, 1641,
Richelieu declared that the <i>parlements</i> had been established only
for granting justice, forbade any modification of decrees, ordered
that in financial matters they might remonstrate once, but in administrative
matters no remonstrance was allowed. During the
remainder of Louis XIII’s reign they were obedient; but on the
death of the king they immediately manifested their vitality by
breaking his will and fixing the regency.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Fronde</i> was the acme of the parliamentary resistance of this
period. Louis XIV. did not forget this high-handed opposition,
and consequently by two decrees he reduced this recalcitrant body
to a strictly subordinate position for the last forty years of his
reign.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> But on the death of the <i>Grand Monarch</i>, the <i>Parlement</i>
showed its old spirit, annulled the will of the dead king concerning
the regency, and for twenty years solemnly reiterated its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
vague constitutional claims in elaborate remonstrances. To this
period of activity succeeded a time of comparative submission,
in which the remonstrances are less prompt, haughty, and insistent.</p>

<p>In 1748, the struggle renewed itself, and soon each side showed
an ardent determination to conquer. The monarch resorted to
<i>lits de justice</i>, to exile, and to the institution of irregular courts in
order to provoke the magistrates to obey, while they answered
with <i>iterative</i> remonstrances and with refusals to dispense justice.
From these remonstrances we are able to ascertain the pretensions
of the <i>Parlement</i>, and to trace, though with much vagueness and
incoherence, those principles which they called constitutional and
fundamental. On the other hand, the responses of the king reveal
the persistent claims of absolutism as to the royal source of
law.</p>

<p>The magistrates based their shadowy claims upon different
grounds. Frequently they appealed to precedent; as in 1718, the
<i>Parlement</i> of Paris declared that the most absolute kings, specifically
Louis XIV., had <i>continually</i> made use of the <i>Parlement</i> for
registration.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Justice and expediency were also invoked in their
support.</p>

<p>Already in the period of the regency, following closely after
their submissiveness under Louis XIV, we find a hazy but general
distinction between statutory and constitutional laws:
“While we recognize, Sire, that you alone are lord and master
and the sole lawgiver, and that there are laws which changing
times, the needs of your people, the maintenance of order and the
administration of your kingdom may oblige you to modify, substituting
new ones according to the forms always observed in this
state, we nevertheless believe it to be our duty to call to your
attention the existence of laws as old as the monarchy, which are
permanent and invariable, the guardianship of which was committed
to you along with the crown itself.... It is by reason of
the permanence of such laws that we have you as lord and master.
It is this permanence which leads us to hope that the crown,
having rested upon your head during a long, just, and glorious
reign, will pass to your posterity for all time to come. In recent
times [the <i>Parlement</i> adds] it has been clearly shown how much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
France owes to the maintenance of these original laws of the state,
and how important it is in the service of your Majesty that your
<i>Parlement</i>, which is responsible to you and to the nation for their
exact observations, should assiduously guard them against any
encroachment.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Here then is found in embryo the programme
which the magistrates pursued in their legislative opposition to
the crown. Nevertheless there is, judging from a comparison of
these earlier remonstrances and those emitted later, some progress
in the distinction of organic and of statutory law, and in the
enumeration of the fundamental principles.</p>

<p>The <i>Parlement</i> of Brittany, in a remonstrance of July, 1771,
said: “There is an essential difference between the transitory
regulations which vary with the times, and the fundamental laws
upon which the Constitution of the monarchy rests. In respect
to the former [that is the transitory regulations] it is the duty of
the courts to direct and enlighten the ruling power (l’autorité),
although their opinions must, in the last instance, yield to the
decision of your wisdom, since it appertains to you alone to regulate
everything relating to the administration. To administer
the state is not, however, to change its constitution.... It is,
therefore, most indispensable to distinguish or to except the cases
where the right of expostulation suffices to enlighten the ruling
power in an administration which, in spite of its wide scope, still
has its limits, and those cases where the happy inability [of the
monarch] to overstep the bounds established by the constitution
implies the power necessary legally to oppose what an arbitrary
will cannot and may not do.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> To determine accurately the content
of the <i>lois fondamentales</i> of which the <i>Parlements</i> asserted
themselves to be protectors, is difficult. The <i>Parlements</i> themselves
did not deem it expedient, either for their own claims or for
those of the monarch, to attempt a too explicit formulation of
these laws; vagueness was regarded a political virtue. A remonstrance
of the <i>cour des comptes, aides et finances</i> of Normandy,
openly admitted the disadvantage of such an enumeration:
“Deign, Sire, to examine for yourself to what the decree of December<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
tends; it seems destined to draw the line between the
power of the sovereign and the liberty of his subjects; this line
always undetermined, which no hand has been bold enough to
fix, which a salutary veil covers with useful shadows; the tenderness
of princes for their people and the love of the people for their
princes draw or withdraw these shadows according to the times
or the reigns. Those who dare to-day to fix these limits and to
say to France: There ends the legitimate liberty of the people,
serve your interests badly, even politically.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The most precise formulation of the organic law of the French
monarchy which I have found is the protest of the princes,
signed April 4, 1771, and directed against the <i>Maupeou Parlement</i>:
“We, the undersigned, consider that the French monarchy
has been sustained, together with the glory, the splendor, and the
power which it has enjoyed for so many centuries only by the
maintenance of the primitive laws which are inherent in it, and
form its title (droit) and essence; that the liberty belonging to
every Frenchman, the title and the ownership of his property,
that of inheriting from fathers or of receiving from relatives or
friends, without being able to be deprived or hindered, otherwise
than by the legal application of law for some crime previously
and competently judged, and not by arbitrary and absolute will,
are not the only rights of the nation and of the subjects nor the
only fundamental laws of the monarchy; that the right of
Frenchmen, one of the most useful to the monarch and one of the
most precious to his subjects, is to have certain bodies of citizens,
perpetual and irremovable, acknowledged in all times by the
kings and by the nation, who under whatever form and name
they have existed, concentrated in themselves the general right
of every subject to invoke the laws, to demand their rights, and
to have recourse to the Prince; whose most important functions
have always been to be charged with watching over the
maintenance of the established laws, to weigh in new laws their
utility or the dangers of contradictions which might occur with
the old laws, to verify them, and to represent to the sovereign all
that is prejudicial to the rights of his subjects or to the primordial
and constitutive laws of his kingdom ...; that this necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
surety cannot exist without irremovability of the title of those to
whom are confided so important functions, that they have always
been regarded as one of the principal safeguards of public liberty
against the abuse of arbitrary power; that they are an integral
part of the constitution of the State, and are found as much as
any other law in the order of the fundamental laws of the monarchy.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
However, the apparent attempt to be explicit here
originates primarily, not in a desire to state distinctly the constitutional
law, but rather to protect the prerogatives of the <i>Parlements</i>
by coupling them with certain principles generally recognized
as inviolable.</p>

<p>The <i>Parlements</i>, in their resistance to the royal power, showed,
as early as the Fronde, a tendency to support each other, but it is
particularly in the period of the <i>Maupeou Parlement</i> that the
claims to <i>unity</i> and <i>indivisibility</i> became prominent.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> These
remonstrances, as well as the royal responses, were not withheld
from the public, as the <i>ordonnances</i> which imposed upon the
magistrates the duty of keeping their deliberations secret implied,
but were hawked about the streets and eagerly welcomed by
the people. Since in times of opposition, each <i>Parlement</i> aroused
the sympathies of the citizens under its jurisdiction, their combination
for mutual support against the crown extended the area of
popular agitation. This exciting literature, issuing from the different
courts, had, therefore, an educative effect upon the popular
mind, rather in emphasizing the need of some limitation to royal
power than in developing distinct and well-defined notions of
political laws.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The <i>Parlement</i>, while professing exemplary obedience
to the king, said that there were moral limits to their
obedience.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> That also took a popular turn, in professing to represent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
the nation or the people in the absence of the States-General.
The remonstrance of the <i>cour des aides</i>, probably drawn up by
Malesherbes, in February, 1771, indicates these popular pretensions.
“The courts are to-day the only protectors of the feeble
and the unfortunate: there have existed for a long time no States-General
and in the greater part of the kingdom no provincial
estates; all the bodies, except the courts, are reduced to a mute
and passive obedience. No individual in the provinces would
venture to expose himself to the vengeance of a <i>commandant</i>, of a
<i>commissaire du conseil</i>, and still less to those of a minister of Your
Majesty. The courts are then the only ones to whom it is still
permitted to raise a voice in favor of the people, and Your Majesty
does not wish to take away this last resource from distant provinces.
But this decree, exiling the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris, tends to
render this resource illusory.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding this avowed guardianship of the national
rights, the feeling gradually grew that these ill-defined fundamental
laws were too vague, that the <i>Parlements</i>, though persistent,
stopped short of pertinacity, and that an aristocratic magistracy
was not the real representation of the nation.</p>

<p>The first expression, so far as I have noted, of the need of a
more definite political rampart against the crown was that of the
Marquis de Mirabeau and his brother. In 1754, the Marquis
wrote to his brother: “The more I consider the abuses of society
and their remedy, the more I return to what you said to me five
years ago, ... that twelve principles established in twelve lines,
once written in the head of the Prince or of his minister, and
exactly followed in details, would correct and regenerate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
everything.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> But this was only a solitary voice crying in the wilderness;
it neither found a response in the people, nor became the
determined policy of its enunciator.</p>

<p>The people, however, were awakening at least to the abuses of
the <i>ancien régime</i>, and were groping after a remedy. Books,
dealing with the right of insurrection, of the superiority of the
nation to the crown, and with the refutation of divine rights and
passive obedience, were written, read and discussed.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Humanitarian
views, the theory of natural rights, and, consequently, a sense
of the importance of the third estate, gained ground by degrees.
Meanwhile the contest between the king and his <i>Parlements</i> continued.
The Notables, called in 1787, affirmed that <i>the imprescriptible
right to determine financial questions belonged only to the
representatives of the nation</i>.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The States-General were called for
1789,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Owing to the failure of the monarch or minister, purposely
or otherwise, to take the initiative, the radical element of
the nation were able to secure almost universal suffrage and the
union of the orders in one body. Judging from the <i>cahier</i> and
the pamphlets of 1788 and 1789, we infer that the consciousness
of the inadequacy of the old French Constitution was general.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
The <i>cahiers</i>, upon the question of the French Constitution, were
moreover divided; some desired the preservation of the old Constitution,
some a declaration of the rights of the nation, some a
<i>charte</i>, while one formulated a new, complete constitution; on the
whole, a majority favored a more careful guarantee of the nation’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
rights.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The <i>cahiers</i>, it must be remarked, show a more perfect
and uniform programme of civil reform than of political.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>The pamphlets of the day, being the expression of the convictions
of individuals, reveal more clearly the political thought of
the radical element. Count de Mirabeau’s <i>Lettres de cachet</i>, published
in 1783, may be regarded as among the earliest of such
personal expressions. Its attitude was rather negative than constructive.
It attempted to show that a despotism depended not at
all upon the character of the particular sovereign, but on the
absence or insufficiency of laws; that France without a veritable
constitution was only a despotic state, and that there is no mean
between an absolute despotism and the absolute reign of law.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
In 1787, the Count declared, “What is necessary is a constitution;
France is ripe for the Revolution.”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Other pamphlets of 1788 and 1789 indicate a tendency to discuss
constitutional law from the historical and crudely comparative
standpoint, and to apply the conclusions to the present conditions,
but in the attempt to formulate their results, they are less clear
and coherent. One of these drawn up in 1789 devotes one hundred
and thirty-seven pages to the discussion of the influence of
Montesquieu in the present Revolution, and denounces him for
not declaring boldly that France was a despotism. It concluded
that France has in reality no constitution.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>How far the king meant that the States-General should possess
a constitutional character is difficult to determine. The Letter of
Summons repeatedly asserts the desire to affect a “fixed and constant
order in all parts of the administration.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Mirabeau claimed
that the king himself had recognized “the necessity of giving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
France a fixed method of government,”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and La Marck confirmed
this declaration.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> We shall perhaps have attributed sufficient
meaning to these hazy avowals if we say that Louis XVI., partly
from his paternal spirit, and partly from a desire for relief from
financial crises, meditated, in his more liberal moods, granting the
nation some sort of a <i>charter</i>, in the formulation of which he
wished the assistance of the States-General. This resuscitated
institution convened at Versailles, May 5, 1789.</p>

<p>The first months were occupied in the disputes over the verification
of the powers of the deputies. On May 28, a representative
of the nobility, Count de Crillon, said that “he was of the firm
opinion that it was less for maintaining than for establishing the
Constitution that they were called together.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> On June 15, Abbé
Siéyès announced that those whose powers had been verified represented
ninety-six per cent. of the nation, and suggested as a
fitting name, “<i>Assemblée des représentants</i>.” Mirabeau, at the
same session, offered a series of resolutions that provoked much
discussion, one of which affirmed that their first duty was “to
agree upon and to fix legally the principles for the regeneration of
the kingdom, to assure the rights of the people, to adopt the basis
of a wise and useful constitution, and, to secure these rights from
all attempts, they shall be put under the safeguard of the legislative
power of the king and of the National Assembly.” Rabaud de
Saint Étienne, in another series of resolutions, expressed the same
conviction.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Two days later, the name “National Assembly”
was adopted and an oath taken “to fulfill with zeal and fidelity
the duties which devolve upon us.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Debarred from the place
usually occupied by the Assembly by the carpenters who were at
work upon it, the members of the third estate held their meeting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
June 20, in the Tennis Court at Versailles, and there adopted the
resolution which declared the National Assembly a Constitutional
Convention, and subscribed to the following, known as the Tennis
Court Oath: “The National Assembly, regarding itself as called
upon to establish the Constitution of the kingdom, effect a regeneration
of the state and maintain the true principles of the monarchy,
may not be prevented from continuing its deliberations in
whatever place it may be forced to take up its sittings. It further
maintains that wherever its members are assembled, there is the
National Assembly. The Assembly decrees that all its members
shall immediately take a solemn oath never to be dissolved and
to come together whenever circumstances may dictate, until the
Constitution of the kingdom shall be established and placed upon
a firm foundation.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> It is beyond the sphere of our inquiry to
follow this Constituent Assembly in their arduous and complex
task of formulating a constitution, and of legislating at the same
time for the kingdom, while exposed to court intrigues and popular
intrusion.</p>

<p>Therefore, to conclude this chapter as we began, we have shown
that the resolution of June 20 was neither a political freak, nor an
act of imitation of a foreign nation. The example of the American
Republic may have given stimulus and precision, yet the
Tennis Court Oath must be regarded as the logical consequence
of a transformation, which had been in progress for more than
sixty years.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ORIGIN_OF_THE_REPUBLIC">THE ORIGIN OF THE REPUBLIC.</h2>

</div>

<p>Louis XVI., in 1789, was praised by the mass of the French
nation as the best of monarchs, and as the restorer of national
liberties; his name was coupled with that of Henry IV., a king about
whom tradition had thrown a halo of glory. But, on September
21, 1792, the newly-chosen Convention abolished the monarchy.
So rapid is the transition from the one phase of the national feeling
to the other, that it occasions a surmise either that the professed
loyalty to the monarch in 1789 was not sincere, or that the
action of the Convention was the work of a coterie of radicals, who
misrepresented the popular feeling. A review of the period intervening
between 1789 and 1792 shows that both of these suppositions
are unwarranted, and confirms the conclusion that there
was a progressive development of hostility, first to Louis XVI.
and the royal family, and then to the monarchical government.</p>

<p>Previous to 1789, the term <i>Republic</i> is used by French publicists
or agitators, but it is either in a sense so qualified as to be consistent
with the monarchy, or as a form of government unsuited to
France with its actual traditions and conditions.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The very nearly
unanimous feeling and judgment in 1789 was that the monarchy
was the best form of government for France, and that the chief
need was to regenerate it. We have said that one hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
ninety-four <i>cahiers</i> specifically asked for the retention of the monarchy;
the silence of the others upon this question must not be
construed to mean that their authors were indifferent or opposed
to the monarchy, but rather that they believed it unnecessary to
ask for what they already had, and against which there was no
strong movement. As Paris may rightly be considered the source
of the anti-monarchical agitation, the attitude of the third estate
in this city at the opening of the Revolution may justly be taken
to represent the feeling of the radical element toward the monarchy.
In their <i>cahier</i> they said: “In the French monarchy, the
legislative power belongs to the nation conjointly with the king;
to the king alone belongs the executive power.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The <i>sub-cahiers</i>
from the districts of the city expressed the same idea.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> In truth,
in not a single <i>cahier</i> examined do we find a hint of any opposition
to the monarchy. Hence, it is to be inferred that, if any individuals
had Republican inclinations, these inclinations were not shared
by any appreciable part of the nation. A few men of the reform
party, Lauragnais, Lally-Tollendal, and Montlosier, ventured to
say that the French monarchy had originally been elective and
that the elective monarchy would consequently be not an innovation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
but a restoration of their early system;<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> but the adherence
of these men to the monarchy in the early days of the <i>Constituent
Assembly</i> is conclusive that by the elective monarchy they did not
mean the Republic of 1792.</p>

<p>The Constituent Assembly, having been formed out of the
States General, had to formulate a constitution for the regeneration
of France, and was obliged, therefore, to specify the divisions
of government, designate the organs and the functions of each division,
prescribe their powers, limitations, sources and transmission;
hence the debates and decrees of this national body may be taken
as indicative of the public sentiment toward the monarch. Here
may be traced the changes worked in the public mind, the censure
or the eulogy of persons and institutions. As this national assembly
itself became transformed by the withdrawal of the more conservative
elements, it reflected rather faithfully the change that
was taking place in the minds of the radical classes of France.</p>

<p>This Assembly frequently gave expression of its satisfaction
with the monarch and with the monarchy. Near the close of the
famous session of August 4, 1789, when feudalism had been so
enthusiastically renounced by its own favored sons, M. Lally-Tollendal
proposed that they should proclaim “Louis XVI. the
Restorer of French liberty.” “The proclamation,” we are told,
“was made immediately by the deputies, by the people, and by all
those who were present, and the National Assembly resounded
for a quarter of an hour with the cries ‘<i>Vive le roi; vive Louis
XVI., restaurateur de la liberté française</i>.’”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> As early as July 4,
1789, Gouverneur Morris, a careful observer of the French spirit
and movements, wrote: “They wish an American Constitution,
with a king in the place of a president.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> On August 28, 1789,
Mounier presented a project of the monarchical element of the
Constitution, and a member made the following statement, the
verity of which was not disputed: “Here we should reflect upon
the national spirit. For fourteen centuries the French, free to
direct themselves by the republican spirit, preferred the peacefulness
of the monarchic government to the storms of a republican
government.... Louis XVI. is no more upon the throne by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
chance of birth, he is there by the choice of the nation; it has
raised him there, as formerly our brave ancestors raised Pharamond
upon the shield. No one contests the monarchical government.
All the <i>cahiers</i> are certainly clear ... we cannot avoid the
conclusion, the only government which is suitable to our manners
(<i>moeurs</i>), to our climate, to the extent of our provinces, is the
monarchical government.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Other speeches made on the same
occasion are indicative of the strong monarchical spirit that possessed
the Assembly at this stage of its history.</p>

<p>Twenty days later, M. de Baron de Juigne proposed to consecrate
the principles of the heredity of the crown and the inviolability
of the king’s person. Scarcely were these principles announced,
than the Assembly proclaimed them by an unanimous
movement.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> These principles were embodied in the decree of
September 17, 1789.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>From these citations, we are warranted in the inference that the
members of the Constituent Assembly in its earlier period regarded
the monarchy as the natural and the most suitable form
of government for France. On the question of the division of
powers, the number of chambers, the elective or hereditary kingship,
the absolute or limited veto, there were differences of opinion;
but national tradition and personal attachment to Louis XVI.
were of sufficient force to bar any discussion of other possible
forms for the executive branch.</p>

<p>The first strong manifestation of personal displeasure toward
the king reflected in the Assembly, was aroused by his attempt to
escape from the country with the royal family, on June 20 and 21,
1791. Fearing to be held longer as a hostage by the revolutionary
party and to be supplanted by the invading <i>émigrés</i>, the king
with his family sought to reach the eastern frontier and there to
be free to act independently of both factions; but at Varennes
he was arrested and brought back to face the enraged Parisians.
It is then that words of displeasure were first heard in the
Assembly. What shall be done with the royal fugitive? was then
the living question. Some contended that he was inviolable and
could not be called to account; others, that his inviolability extended
only to public actions, not to private; while still others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
maintained that he had, by his treason, forfeited his inviolability.
The agitation which reigned without found some expression
within the Assembly. A committee reported, July 13, that the
flight of the king was not a constitutional offense, that the principle
of inviolability did not permit Louis XVI. to be put on trial.
For three days the discussion over the king’s inviolability was
carried on. Pétion, Putraink, Vadier, Robespierre, Prieur, Grégoire,
Buzot spoke against, and Larochefoucault, Liancourt,
Prugnon, Duport, Goupil de Prefeln, Salles and Barnave for the
inviolability. Only Condorcet attempted to show the fitness of
France for a Republic.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The people were astir without; they met
on the squares, in the public places, crowded around the Assembly,
and urged the dethronement of the king or the reference of the
question to the people of the eighty-three departments. Petitions,
posters, and ardent declamations were instruments by which the
radicals sought to turn public opinion their way.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> On July 16,
1791, a decree of the Assembly defined the acts whereby the king
should be considered as no longer inviolable. Should he, having
taken the oath to the Constitution, violate it: or should he put
himself at the head of an army against the nation, or should he
fail to oppose such an act on the part of his generals, he should
be considered to have abdicated, and might be brought to trial
like any ordinary citizen. His executive functions, suspended
June 25, were not to be restored till the completion of the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The Constitution was completed and reviewed, and on September
14, 1791, the king went to the Constituent Assembly, accepted
the Constitution, and, amid prolonged applause, subscribed to this
new instrument that was to give liberty to France. He was
escorted back to the Tuileries by the entire Assembly. The flight
of the monarch seemed forgotten or forgiven.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>On September 30th, the monarch made the closing speech to
the Assembly and was greeted with repeated shouts of <i>Vive le Roi</i>.
The President responded to the royal speech by an eulogy upon
the monarch and a compliment upon the form of government inaugurated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
under the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Though the Constituent
Assembly had not laid sacrilegious hands upon the time-honored
monarchy of France further than to divest it of some of its privileges
and prerogatives, though the storm of displeasure, incurred
by the ill-advised flight of June 20th, had apparently subsided and
the Assembly and the king had exchanged expressions of mutual
esteem, and had sworn to preserve the great document so laboriously
wrought out by the French Lycurguses, yet the leaven had
been engendered which, under favorable circumstances, would
leaven the whole lump and transform the limited monarchy into
a republic. Ideas have their origin in individual minds, are advocated
by these individuals, and by and by the nucleus of devotees
has grown into a party that serves as an organ of propagation
and makes use of the instrumentalities of their age for the dissemination
of their views and for the moulding of public opinion into
conformity thereto. If the conditions are favorable, the new ideas
secure acceptance and are embodied in institutions; but if the
conditions are hostile, the conceptions are rejected and relegated
to that vast repository where are accumulated the world’s Utopias;
thence some ardent soul may bring forward the idea at a time
which is propitious, and the Utopia may become a practical reality.
It is our task to endeavor to discover the notion of a republic
for France as it was conceived and promulgated by those individuals
who may be called the precursors of French republicanism,
to trace the formation of an organic body for its promulgation,
and to find the means used in the formation of a public opinion
sufficiently strong to secure the adoption of the Republic of 1792.</p>

<p>There were already in 1789 a few ardent natures enthusiastic
over the transformation to be wrought in France, who harbored a
vague desire to see the monarchy abolished and a more liberal
government instituted. Whence had come this hazy notion which
wrought up their feelings may only be conjectured. Perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
classic studies upon which the Jesuits and Oratorians nourished
their pupils had made them familiar with the Greek and Roman
Republics.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Either the Social Contract, or the example of the
American colonies, may have given them their republican notions.</p>

<p>Camille Desmoulins, an ardent, impetuous son of liberty, gave
unequivocal expression of republican sentiments as early as 1789,
and even asserted that the republican form of government was best
suited for France.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> In May, 1793, in two addresses, made in answer
to Brissot, he confirms his early preference for republicanism.
He said: “In the month of July, 1789, the number of Republicans
in Paris did not probably exceed ten: and this it is which crowns
with eternal glory those old members of the <i>Club of Cordeliers</i>,
who began building the edifice of the republic with such slight
materials.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In June, 1790, he used the term Congress of the
Republic of France in speaking of the Constituent Assembly,
and said that only four republicans had had the courage to resist
the royal budget of 25,000,000 voted upon in the Assembly.
Again in the Jacobin Club, October 21, 1791, at the time when
France was big with hope that the new Constitution would work,
Desmoulins pointed out its imperfections and favored republican institutions.
Here then was one mind already thinking of a republic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
and claiming that in the <i>Cordelier Club</i> there were others who, at
that early period, shared his opinions. Who these were he does
not say.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The district of the city called the Cordeliers had
formed a popular society which manifested a severely critical
spirit toward the monarchical and aristocratic legislation. This
district clamored for liberty of the press,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and championed the
political rights of passive citizens.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> It took the side of the sixty districts
which kept up their popular electoral assemblies and which
continued to meet in the interim of elections, as against the
forty-eight sections, which convened only for elections. The
ardent opposition of the Cordeliers to the Assembly and to the
municipality doubtless provoked the enactment of the law which,
on May 27, 1790, transformed these districts into the sections.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
Then forming the <i>Club of Cordeliers, the Society of the Rights of
Man and of Citizens</i>, this district continued its policy of aggression
upon the conservatives, until their more democratic programme
became an accomplished fact. Here then was a company
of men, having a common interest in extreme radicalism, meeting
frequently and fanning into fuller heat by their addresses the
embers of opposition. This society, anti-aristocratic, anti-monarchical,
occasionally uttered republican sentiments and indulged
in the word republic. They remarked the inconsistency between
the principles contained in the Declaration of the Rights of Man
and an hereditary monarchy, resting upon the divine right of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
kings.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> On June 22, 1791, the <i>Club of Cordeliers</i> issued an address
to the Assembly showing its republican proclivities, much
to the displeasure of the Jacobins. They said: “We conjure you,
in the name of the country, either to declare immediately that
France is no more a monarchy, that it is a republic, or at least to
wait until all the departments, until all the primary assemblies,
have expressed their wish upon this important question, before
thinking of replacing a second time the most fair Empire of the
world in chains and in the limits of monarchism.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The flight of
the king was the occasion that called for this expression of animosity
to the monarchy and the preference for a republic. Even
before the attempted escape, another newspaper had joined with
Desmoulins in his strong anti-monarchical views and in the suggestion
of a more suitable form of government for France. Prudhomme,
the publisher of booklets and pamphlets of the liberal
party previous to, and during the Revolution, had established a
paper devoted to the new ideas, the <i>Révolutions de Paris</i>. The
experienced publisher had discovered the practical sagacity and
the sincere democratic proclivities of a young advocate from
Bourdeaux, recently come to Paris, Loustallot, who had already in
1789 proved himself a good pamphleteer for the reformers. These
two men began the issue of their sheet July 12, 1789. In its earlier
numbers the slavery of the Frenchmen to the aristocracy was bitterly
censured, but the king is not treated so much with hostility
as with pity for his weakness.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Whether Loustallot would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
continued to advocate liberal monarchical views had he lived,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> we
shall not venture to say; but in the spring of 1791,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> the paper had
changed its spirit toward the king. The issue of April 21-30
gave notice of a decree proposed to the National Assembly advocating
the abolition of royalty. After citing a long list of considerations,
chiefly of the evils of kings and of the inconsistency of
such an institution with the <i>rights of man</i>, twenty-one articles
were given proposing the abolition of royalty and the substitution
of a President.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Subsequent numbers continued to discuss favorably
the abolition of the monarchy. In No. 91 a letter was printed
which suggested the placing of a ballot-box in each of the churches
to receive the vote of the people upon the question at issue.
The writer shows himself friendly to the change. Another
friend of the proposal, in a letter printed in No. 92<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>, opposed this
mode of voting, lest the monarchists should take advantage of it.
Instead, he proposed that the vote should be collected <i>viva voce</i>,
a list made of those voting; this list should be sent to the Assembly,
yet care should be taken to keep a duplicate in order to avoid
any surprise. No. 96 contained an article upon “The White
Elephant,” advocating, in a facetious manner, similar ideas. The
same number entered into an examination of these three propositions,
the first two of which it decided affirmatively, the last one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
negatively. I. Whether the elements and the principles of our
Constitution are not in continual opposition to the form of our
government. II. Whether every hereditary delegation is not a
violation of rights and a contradiction in principles. III. Whether
the illustrious citizen of Geneva is mistaken when he says that the
monarchy is a government contrary to nature.</p>

<p>But the most venomous assault upon the king and upon royalty
appeared in the number of June 18-25, which reported the king’s
flight. Denunciatory epithets were heaped upon the faithless
monarch. “Julius Cæsar, poigniarded by the Romans; Charles
I., decapitated by the English, were innocent, if we compare them
to Louis XVI.... If the President of the National Assembly
had put to vote upon the question whether we should have a
republican form of government, in the <i>Place de Grève</i>, in the
Garden of Tuileries and in the Palace of Orléans, France would
no more be a monarchy.” Such were some of the contents of
this liberal Parisian paper.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The next issue (No. 103) found
fault with the National Assembly for not dealing severely with
the king, and said that, inasmuch as war would come anyway,
it had better come under a republic than under a monarch or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
a regent. Here also appeared an announcement of the propagandism
of liberty, of which the Girondists spoke so enthusiastically
a year later.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> A few numbers later, an article censured the
indifference of the people in regard to the elections for the coming
Legislative Assembly, saying that upon the composition of this
body would depend the safety of the republic. The Constituent
Assembly is not spared criticism for making the Constitution
unalterable by the Legislative Assembly.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> In subsequent numbers
of the autumn of 1791, the monarchical features of the Constitution
were pointed out and criticised.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Later on, the republic
was mentioned less frequently, nevertheless royalty was still attacked.
The issue which gave an account of the events of August
10, 1792, the determination of the Legislative Assembly to suspend
the king and to call a National Convention to determine the
nature of the executive office, referred to the king as “Louis
XVI., whom we shall call no more the king of the French.”
The number following advised the members of the convention
that their first work should be to dethrone the monarch, but a
republic was not explicitly recommended.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> That this paper exercised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
considerable influence in arousing hostility to the king and
to the monarchy, and in suggesting a republic, seems quite reasonable,
when we remember that its weekly circulation reached
nearly two hundred thousand copies.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>We have deemed it advisable to follow the <i>Révolutions de Paris</i>
through to the proclamation of the republic, in order to give a
connected account of the direction in which this popular publication
attempted to sway public opinion. Having noted that its
positive republicanism was manifest in April, two months before
Louis XVI’s unsuccessful attempt at exodus, we shall endeavor
to see what was the strength which this party possessed in the
summer of 1791.</p>

<p>Bonneville’s paper, <i>Bouche de fer</i>, in June, 1791, pronounced
against a monarchy, a protectorate, and a regency, and urged an
united declaration to the effect that they wanted no more of these.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
A placard was posted at the door of the Assembly, July 1st, announcing
that a society of republicans had resolved to publish a
paper, <i>Le Republican</i>, for pointing out the abuses of monarchy and
for enlightening the minds of the people upon republicanism. This
was signed by Duchastellet.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> A few copies of this paper were
published within this month.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Montlosier mentions the existence
of a republican party after the flight of the king,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and Gouverneur
Morris wrote, July 13, 1791, what confirms the same fact. Here
is what he said: “This step was a very foolish one.... His departure
changed everything, and now the general wish seems to
be for a republic, which is quite in the natural order of things.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
On the eve of the convening of the Legislative Assembly, September
30, 1791, Morris wrote to Washington the following
explicit observations upon the status of the republican movement:
“The new Assembly, as far as can at present be determined, is
deeply imbued with republican or, rather, democratic principles.
The southern part of the kingdom is in the same disposition; the
eastern is attached to Germany and would gladly be united to the
empire; Normandy is aristocratical, and so is part of Brittany;
the interior part of the kingdom is monarchal. This map is (you
may rely on it) just, for it is the result of great and expensive investigation
made by the Government.”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Brissot’s paper, <i>Patriote
français</i>, of June 25, 1791, in analyzing the proposals then made
for the executive department of the government, said: “The first
opinion which has been presented to the public is decisive,—No
more kings, let us be republicans,—such has been the cry of the
Palais Royal, of some societies, of some writers.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Thomas
Paine’s letter in response to Siéyès, published in the <i>Patriote
français</i>, July 11, declares the American system of government
superior to every other, and closes the letter with these suggestive
words: “Enfin c’est à tout l’enfer de la monarchie que j’ai déclaré
la guerre.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>From these accumulated statements, we infer that about Paris,
in the spring of 1791, especially after the 20th of June, there was
much agitation in favor of the dethronement of Louis XVI, some
for the change of the royal family, and a perceptible tendency in
favor of a republic. After the acceptance of the Constitution by
the king and by the Legislative Assembly, the constitutional question
of the kingship is little discussed till in the summer of 1792.
Then the Legislative Assembly was frightened over the defeat of
the French army at Lille and at Tournay, the disastrous defeat
of Biron’s army at Mons, and the probable advance of the
Austrian army upon Paris. The king, following the advice of
Montmorin and Malouet, had sent Mallet du Pan on a mission to
the German courts to secure a manifesto of intimidation against
the factious Frenchmen.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The <i>Austrian committee</i> was denounced
boldly in the journals and in the Assembly.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>Incited by this array of reverses, royal intrigues, and threatened
invasion, the Assembly passed three decrees for the protection of
the country: May 27, the deportation of the non-juring priests;
May 29, the dismissal of the king’s guard; June 8, the formation
of a camp of 20,000 fédérés at Paris. The king opposed his veto to
the first and last of these. The Girondin ministry was dismissed
early in June.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The invasion of the Tuileries, June 20, was the
result of these aggravations. The petition presented to the Legislative
Assembly by the crowd on that day does not solicit the
establishment of a republic, but urges that the king should fulfill
his constitutional function of protecting liberty.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The king continued
to be disturbed by the people. The manifesto of the Duke
of Brunswick, July 27, greatly excited the Parisians, already
much aroused. Then from the sections of Paris, from administrative
bodies, and from communes, addresses were sent in asking
for the suspension or the dethronement of the king.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The significant
fact about this outcry for the removal of Louis is the silence
about what is to supersede him. The <i>commune</i> representing the
forty-eight sections of Paris, through Pétion, presented at the
bar of the Assembly, August 3, a petition most vehement in its
denunciation of the faithless monarch and most startling in the
picture presented of the country’s danger; but this <i>commune</i>, the
most radical, perhaps, in France, invoked the Constitution in
praying for his dethronement.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The Legislative Assembly hesitated to take upon itself the
work of deposition. The sections gave it till midnight of the 9th
of August to decide; if at that time the dethronement had not
been voted, the tocsin should sound and the <i>générale</i> should beat
for the insurrection. The Assembly adjourned at 7 o’clock without
deciding the question. The 10th of August the King was
driven from the Tuileries, and took refuge in the Assembly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
Even then the legislators only suspended the King until “the
National Convention should pronounce upon the measures which
it believes ought to be adopted for assuring the sovereignty of the
people and the reign of liberty and equality.”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>August 11, the Assembly provided for the mode of election for
the members of the new Convention, and gave universal suffrage
to males over 21 years. Did it ask that the delegates should be
instructed to vote for the monarchy or the republic? No; but they
were to be given “unlimited confidence.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> M. Aulard has analyzed
for us the powers given by the primary assemblies to the
electoral assemblies of the Departments and by the latter to the
deputies. He notes that almost universally the primary assemblies
conformed to the advice to grant unlimited powers to the
departmental electors. At the final election of deputies, September
2, in thirty-four Departments the electors made no allusion to
what powers should be bestowed upon their representatives; in
thirty-six they gave them “unlimited powers” or “unlimited confidence;”
in two Departments, the Lower Pyrenees and Somme,
the previous question was raised upon the powers to be given; in a
single one (Charente) they gave as mandate the oath taken by the
electors, “to maintain equality and liberty.” In three Departments,
Aisne, Eure-et-Soir, and Paris, they gave full powers with
the restriction that the constitutional laws to be made shall be
submitted to the ratification of the people. Thus all either
“inscribed the formula prescribed by the Legislature or omitted
it as useless and self-evident.”</p>

<p>Shall there be a monarchy or a republic? What was the voice
of the departments upon this question? Only one out of the
eighty-three Departments expressed a clear demand upon this
point. This one, that which includes Paris, asked for “the
form of a republican government.” In the other eighty-two the
word republic was not pronounced. One Department, Jura, however,
attempted to define in rather express terms the sort of
government to be formed, “A temporary executive power, removable
at the option of the people,” but it does not use the term
<i>republic</i>.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Four Departments were pronounced against royalty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
and swore eternal hostility thereto; these were Aube, Charente-Inférieure,
Jura, and Paris. No Department asked the continuance
of the monarchy, and only a few primary assemblies asked
this. These assemblies were in four Departments, <i>i. e.</i>, five in
Allier, one in Ariége, three in the Gironde, and two in Lot-et-Garonne.</p>

<p>If we examine the proceedings of the Jacobin Club, we find that
this society was devoted for some time to the King and to the
constitution.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> No bitter opposition to the monarch is found till
after June 20, 1791. Then it was his violation of the constitution
that caused his denunciation. After the two famous vetoes, a
member proposed in the Club that they make use of Art. vi, Sec.
10, Chapt. 2, of the Constitution, “If the King puts himself
at the head of an army and directs the forces against the nation
... he will be considered to have abdicated royalty.”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The
printing of this discourse was urged on all hands. The Club frequently
mentioned the calling of a convention. Its sympathy
with the work of August 10 is evident,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and its hostility to the
monarchy is more pronounced from this period.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>A definite suggestion of the constructive scheme was made in the
Club, September 7; Chabot introduced the discussion of the form
of government, and referred to two kinds, (1) the federation of the
departments, and (2) a National Council, which should be presided
over in turn by one of the deputies of one of the portions
of the empire. Chabot favored the latter.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Again returning to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
the same question, September 10, Terrasson pronounced a preference
for the federation, and cited Rousseau as his authority and
America for a successful example.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Two days after, September
12, a letter was proposed and was adopted in the Jacobin Club of
Paris, to be sent to the affiliated societies. In it were contained
these three proposals, which may be regarded as setting forth the
policy of the democratic party of Paris; the popular sanction or
popular revision of all the constitutional decrees of the National
Convention; the total abolition of royalty, and the penalty of
death against those who proposed to re-establish it; the <i>republican
form of government</i>.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The significance of this movement on the part of the parent
Jacobin Club must not be overlooked in tracing the progress of
republicanism. The affiliation of well nigh a thousand societies
in other parts of France with the parent society afforded a strong
and thoroughly organized means for concerted political action.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
The nominees of the popular societies were nearly everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
chosen to represent the provinces in the Convention.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> In the list
of deputies from Paris appeared the names of pronounced republicans
and radical Jacobins who might be expected to take a
stand for a popular form of government.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>The Convention held its first meeting in the Tuileries;
only 371 members were present. They verified their powers,
organized by choosing Pétion as President, and by naming five
Secretaries. September 21, they occupied the place of the Legislative
Assembly in the Riding School. Here they had declared
in favor of the following measures suitable for allaying the fears
of disorder: (1) The National Convention declares that there can
only be a constitution when it is accepted by the people; (2)
that the security of person and of property is under the safeguard
of the nation; (3) that all laws not abrogated, and all
powers not revoked or suspended are maintained; (4) that the
existing taxes shall be collected as in the past.</p>

<p>This effected, they were about to adjourn, when Collot d’Herbois
ascended the tribune and said: “You have just passed a wise
resolution, but there is one which you can not put off till tomorrow,
which you can not put off till this evening, which you
can not put off a single instant without being unfaithful to the
wish of the nation; that is the abolition of royalty.” Unanimous
applause greeted this speech. M. Grégoire proposed that “by
a solemn law they sanction the abolition of royalty,” and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
entire Assembly by a spontaneous movement arose and voted this
proclamation by acclamation; a brief discussion followed, and
then with loud bursts of applause they voted, “The National
Convention decrees that royalty is abolished in France.” For
some time the cry “<i>Vive la Nation</i>” was prolonged. At this
juncture a company of 150 <i>chasseurs</i> were admitted to the hall
and swore upon their arms to return only after having triumphed
over all the enemies of liberty and equality. But as yet the word
Republic had not been mentioned in the new Convention.</p>

<p>At the evening session of that day the time was consumed in hearing
of the discourses of divers deputations that had come to congratulate
the Convention upon the great work done that day. Two
of these spoke of the Republic as an already established fact,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
while on the streets, however, of the city the cry was resounding,
“<i>Vive la République</i>.” One orator spoke of nine battalions already
sent to the front, and reported that another was on the
way. “They were coming,” he said, “to pray your blessing
upon their arms, when they learned on the way that they
were to fight no more for kings. They were happy to go to
save the Republic. When they were informed that all your
moments must be consecrated to it, they renounced the enjoyment
of receiving your blessing and went on their way. Our
Department is busy forming new battalions, in seeking to arm
them, and especially in inspiring them with republican manners.”
This was greeted with new applause. The section of
Quatre-Nations was represented by its orator, who said among
other things; “We have given three thousand men for the
frontier; these are three thousand republicans.... We
ask to defile through your midst. If arms are needed, speak, we
shall hasten to use them in the defense of the country, too happy
to pay with our blood for the Republic which you have decreed
for us.” Applause greeted this expression of devotion.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The
newspapers signaled the decree of abolition in enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
descriptions, but only Brissot’s <i>Patriote français</i> proclaimed,
“Royalty is abolished; France is a Republic.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>On the morrow early in the session, Billaud-Varenne moved,
and the Convention decreed, that “all public acts were to be
dated from the first year of the Republic.” A new seal of State
bearing the words “<i>République de France</i>” decided upon and
national colors were proposed, but not adopted.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The journals
took little notice of this new name with which France had been
baptized. Nevertheless, the members of the Convention seemed
to take it as a matter of course and to make repeated use of the
term Republic. For instance, on September 22, it appeared in the
following decree: “The National Convention decrees that the
committees of the legislative assembly and the members of the
executive council shall render an account to the National Convention
of the state of their work and of the condition of the different
parts of the French Republic....” The report of the
Minister of the Interior, M. Gorsas, in the session of September
23, contained this report of the state of public opinion: “The will
of the French is pronounced. Liberty and equality are their
supreme good; they will sacrifice all to preserve these. They
have a horror for the crimes of the nobles, the hypocrisy of the
priests, the tyranny of kings. Kings! they wish no more of
them, they know that outside of a Republic there is no liberty.”
Again on September 24, the Convention decreed “that there
shall be named six commissioners charged with rendering as
full an account as shall be possible, of the present state of the
<i>Republic</i> and that of Paris.” On September 25, the Convention
declared “the French Republic is one and indivisible.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Here we have passed to the period in which the Republic had
become an accepted fact for France. Robespierre said truly that
it had “glided in furtively among the factions,” and we may say
that to Frenchmen, interested in the national defence, it was a
welcome change. Gouverneur Morris is authority for this in a
note of October, 1792, in which he said: “These are the outlines
made use of on either side to convince the public that each is exclusively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
the author of a Republic which the people find themselves
possessed of by a kind of magic, or at least, a sleight of
hand, and which, nevertheless, they are as fond of as if it were
their own offspring.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>It would be interesting to know how completely this Parisian
enthusiasm was shared by the nation. Grave objections may have
been offered, but it soon came about that to be disloyal to the
Republic was to be a foe of liberty and equality, and, worse yet,
a traitor to France. So far as we are able to discover, the army
accepted the Republic with enthusiasm. On September 9, General
Valence wrote to Dumouriez <i>that he would run to the Republic
with transport</i>. Prieur (de la Marne) awakened enthusiasm in
the army of the Ardennes by announcing to them on September
29, the news of the birth of the Republic.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> And a report from
the camp of volunteers at Châlons speaks of a like worthy
sentiment.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>These are the facts about the growth of republican ideas in
Revolutionary France and of the proclamation of the Republic.
We can sum them up as follows: At the meeting of the States-General
in 1789 France was pronouncedly monarchic. A little
coterie of men became anti-monarchical; these developed the
Club of Cordeliers. In 1791, when Louis XVI showed his distrust
of the French people and tried to escape, hostility to the
monarch and also to the monarchy was strong. Even republicanism
was championed by an orator in the Assembly and by a
few newspapers; one of these journals, the <i>Révolutions de Paris</i>,
had a large circulation. The king however accepted the Constitution
in September, 1791, and the outcry against him and in
favor of the abolition of the monarchy subsided. Not until in the
summer of 1792 did the royal vetoes, the menacing manifesto of
the allies, the actual advance of the Prussian army toward Paris,
call forth many petitions and requests for the suspension or for
the dethronement of the king, or for the abolition of the
monarchy.</p>

<p>Comparatively little was said, however, about the form to
be given to the executive. On August 10, the Legislative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Assembly only “suspended Louis XVI provisionally, until the
National Convention should pronounce upon the measures it
believed ought to be adopted for assuring the sovereignty of the
people and the reign of liberty and equality.” Clubs, sections,
journals, and provinces, and even radical democrats, are rather
silent about a substitute for the monarchy. When the abolition
came on September 21, it was received as the news of a national
victory; but at first the term Republic, used on the 22nd, was
little greeted by the nation. It however became the shibboleth of
the army and of the patriots. For this revival of republicanism,
Paris, and perhaps the army, are responsible. The Jacobin Club
of Paris also made use of its influential position to encourage
republican inclinations in the affiliated societies throughout
France, and, what was more important still, to secure the election
of anti-monarchical and of democratic deputies to the Convention.</p>

<p>A few questions remain to be answered. First among these is,
What was the relation between the republican movement of 1791
and that of 1792? The earlier movement must have had a tendency
to increase the number in France who perceived the inconsistency
between individual rights and the equality of men on
the one hand, and the hereditary kingship on the other. It also
increased the number of those who believed a republic suited for
France and who, though they recognized that the realization of
their opinions was for the time being impossible, yet were ready to
strive for its establishment when the circumstances should give
opportunity. To this group of men belongs the credit of having
secured an expression from Paris in favor of the Republic, and of
having secured its early recognition in the city on the abolition
of royalty.</p>

<p>A second question is, Why was there so much said in 1792
about the abolition of monarchy, and so little about the Republic
that should replace it? Why were those of republican preferences
so slow to say it? This may be answered by the statement that
generally, in movements depending upon public opinion, the
people are more pronounced against an abuse or misuse which
they have experienced than about an untried theory; are more
capable to pronounce upon a destructive than upon a constructive
scheme, are more enlightened in their negative than in their
positive actions. The Constituent Assembly was happy in its
negative work of destroying the abuses of the old régime, but less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
felicitous in its positive work of reconstruction. The French
people of 1792 were conversant with the vacillations of the king,
the treasonable intrigues and anti-popular feelings of the court,
but a Republic was as yet an untried and unproved expedient.
Under its name anarchy, or, what to the Parisians was little less
odious, <i>federalism</i>, might become the order of the day. Hence
the very friends of a strong united Republic hesitated to use the
word till the form of the institution should be shaped by the tendency
of affairs. The very friends of Republican government
might have remembered that their use of the word Republic in
1791 had been fraught with bitter schismatic tendencies among
the friends of the Revolution; and how much more dangerous
such a schism in 1792, when the nation found itself called upon
to resist the humiliating invasion of its territory by the allies.
They also knew that to be a republican in 1791 had been unpopular,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
and were chary of exposing themselves to unnecessary odium,
knowing that the monarchy once abolished, they would be by
necessity under a liberal form of government, call it what they
might.</p>

<p>A third query is, Why did the Conventionalists choose the
republican government? The question is easily answered by
another question, <i>i. e.</i>, What other expedient was possible, considering
the state of public opinion? Was it an aristocracy?
But the Revolution in its incipient stages was a revolt against an
aristocracy. Was it a regency? But here the difficulty was to
find a regent who did not share the obloquy of the dethroned
monarch, or was not incapable of commanding the respect of the
nation. Was it under the protection of a foreign prince or power?
Not so; the spirit of national independence was too strong to
suffer even a dispassionate consideration of this. What way
could the Constitutionalists turn? Sorel has truly said: “The
abolition of royalty was the acknowledgment of a fact; the proclamation
of the Republic was the recognition of a necessity. A government
was necessary to France, and no other than a republican
government was possible.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> And the Republic had existed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
fact in France for two short, but very critical periods. From
June 21 to September 14, 1791, the king had been suspended and
the Constituent Assembly had conducted through the ministry
the work of the executive. And again from August 10 to September
21, 1792, the same expedient was resorted to. But it may
be said that the Republic was not in accord with French national
traditions, and that, therefore, it could never be accepted by the
nation. True, France had been a monarchy for centuries, and
the history of her kings was dear to the people in 1789; but there
was a stronger tradition to which the people were more devotedly
attached than to royalty, and now the king had forced
the issue between these two traditions, that is, the tradition of
the monarchy and the tradition of nationality and independence.
So soon as it seemed clear that the French must choose between
these, the choice was made by the abolition of royalty.</p>

<p>Royalty was thus abolished on September 21, 1792: the republic
was recognized by the Convention as its legitimate successor.
The name had been adopted, now a new constitution was necessary;
not one like that of 1791, a base accommodation of hereditary
powers and democratic rights; but one consistently constructed.
The Convention early appointed its Committee of Constitution.
The leader in the committee was Condorcet, and the
majority were Girondists. Their work was ready to be reported
February 15 and 16, 1793. But by this time the republicans
themselves had formed two antagonistic factions, the Girondists
and the Montagnards. The latter were the men of action, and
now held the power in the Convention. Condorcet’s Constitution
was not submitted to the nation.</p>

<p>On May 30, 1793, the Committee of Public Safety was augmented
by five members. These were Couthon, Herault de
Séchelles, Mathieu, Ramel, and Saint Just. They lost no time in
the elaboration of a Constitution, and by June 22, were ready to
report. Herault de Séchelles made the final reading June 24.
Delegates were sent all over France to receive the vote of the
primary assemblies for the acceptance of the Constitutional Act;
1,801,918 votes were cast for its adoption. Their glowing report
was made August 9th by Gossuin, and the next day was fixed as
a national festival “consecrated to the inauguration of the Constitution
of the Republic.” The artist, David, planned the ceremonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>The glorious fundamental law was not, however, to reign in
France. France must be defended from invasion, civil war must
be subdued, and then the rest of Europe must be delivered from
political slavery. In just two months after this inaugural festival,
the Convention decreed that the provisional government
should be revolutionary till peace. When peace came, a new
monarch was enthroned. But these enthusiastic men of 1792 and
1793 had given France a name and an ideal; they had placed above
her horizon a star of hope. When oppression shall make them
weary, or when the popular spirits shall rise, they shall think of a
republic as the aim and end of political effort.</p>

Turgot in a letter to an ecclesiastic, his schoolmate at the Sorbonne, expressed himself
in 1753 in favor of tolerance; another letter of the year following was of like
import. His <i>Conciliateur</i> was printed about the same time. <i>Oeuvres</i>, ii, 353 <i>et seq.</i>,
Paris, 1808. June, 1755, he presented a Memoir to the king on “Toleration, or Religious

de garder tous les communs éléments du Roi, bien de garder les ordonnances qui sont
ses vrais commandements. Ou ce qu’il disait lui-même en 1604 au Souverain: Si
c’est désobéissance de bien servir, le Parlement fait ordinairement cette faute, et
quand il se trouve conflit entre la puissance absolue du Roi et le bien de son service,
il juge l’un préférable à l’autre, non par désobéissance, mais pour son devoir, à la
décharge de sa conscience.” <i>Grandes Remontrances</i>, April 9, 1753; Flammermont,

<p><a id="Footnote_82" href="#FNanchor_82" class="label">[82]</a> The <i>cahier</i> of the nobility of the bailliage of Aumont asked: “Que l’ancienne constitution
française est monarchique, que les lois fondamentales du royaume subsisteront
dans leur intégrité et qu’elles ne pourront être changées par les députés aux États
généraux, Que la formation des États généraux fait partie de la constitution.”...
<i>Arch. Parl.</i>, i, 766. Somewhat similar views are found in the <i>cahiers</i> of the clergy
of Lectoure, <i>Ibid.</i>, ii, 66; of the clergy of Auten, ii, 100; of the clergy of Aval, ii, 137;
of the clergy of Carcassonne, ii, 257; of the clergy of Blois, ii, 376; of the nobility of
Guyenne, ii, 394; of the clergy of Châlons-sur-Marne, ii, 582; of the clergy of Clermont-Ferrand,
ii, 766; of the third estate of Comte de Comminges, iii, 26; of the
nobility of Constances, iii, 52; of the clergy of Etampes, iii, 279; of the nobility of
Libourne, iii, 506; of the nobility of Timoux, iii, 577; of the nobility of Mâcon, iii,

Touraine, vi, 39; of the clergy of Vermandois, vi, 134; of the clergy of Villers-Catterels,
vi, 187; of the clergy of Vitry le François, vi, 207; of the nobility of
Besançon, vi, 516. Some wished to re-establish in more definite terms the old constitution.
The <i>cahier</i> of the clergy of Auxerre asked: “Que les États généraux
s’occuperont d’abord de reconnaître, conserver, fixer irrévocablement, et rendre publiques
les lois constitutionnelles de la monarchie, les droits du Roi et ceux de la nation,”
ii, 111. Of similar import were the <i>cahiers</i> of the clergy of Argenois, i, 675; of the
third estate of Albert, i, 704; of the third estate of Alençon, i, 716; of the third estate
of Exemes, i, 727; of the nobility of Pont-à-Mousson, ii, 229; of the nobility of Castres,

nobility of Montagres, iv, 20; of the Parish of Clermont-Mendon, iv, 440; of the third
estate of Agenois, i, 687. A smaller number of the <i>cahiers</i> asked for a new constitution.
The <i>cahier</i> of the third estate of Paris intra muros presented a model constitution,
essentially similar to the one actually framed, v, 581. The Parish of Toussus-le-Noble,
of Paris, <i>hors des murs</i>, instructed that: Les députés demanderont une
nouvelle constitution nationale, la suppression de toutes les lois, qui, jusqu’à présent,
ont été considérées constitutionnelles, comme illégalement établies et n’ayant pas reçu
l’approbation de la nation, v, 138. The third estate of Mont de Morsan said: Il est
temps qu’on pose les règles fixes, et qu’on assure à la France une Constitution qui
garantisse les droits naturels et imprescriptibles des hommes, iv, 34. The third estate
of Etampes, after referring to the abuses, said: Nos premiers voeux doivent naturellement
se porter sur ce qui doit former à l’avenir la constitution du royaume. Le anciens
monuments nous offrent si peu de conformité et de certitude, que nous devons
profiter des lumières actuelles pour opérer un plus grand bien, iii, 283. The nobility
of Blois said: Le malheur de la France vient de ce qu’elle n’a jamais eu de constitution
fixe, ii, 379.</p>

sense, but in the sense of a monarchy with democratic local institutions. Aubertin,
<i>L’Ésprit public</i>, 278, 279. Even the <i>Ésprit des Lois</i> gave some sanction to a
Republic as an ideal form of government when it recognized <i>virtue</i> as the temper of
society required for this form of government. Voltaire, friend of the monarchy and
critic of Rousseau as he was, wrote: “Le plus tolérable des gouvernements est le
républicain, parce-que c’est celui qui rapproche le plus les hommes de l’égalité naturelle.”
He also compared the frequency of crimes under a monarchy with their infrequency
under republics. Martin, <i>Histoire de France</i>, xvi, 136. Mably held that
France should pass by degrees from a monarchy to a republic. <i>Ibid.</i>, 149 <i>et seq.</i>,

“Pendant toute la durée de la monarchie, tandis que le peuple n’apprenait
presque rien les hautes classes, en général, apprenaient mal. Leur ignorance de
l’histoire nationale explique pourquoi, au moment de la Révolution, on ne put se
rendre un compte exact des faits sociaux et politiques que nous léguait l’ancien régime,
pourquoi on détruisit pêle-mêle ce qu’il y avait de bon et de mauvais dans les institutions
du passé, pourquoi, lorsqu’il s’agit de constituer une nation moderne, le nation
française, on n’eut à la bouche que des exemples empruntés à l’antiquité, à Athènes, à
Sparte, à Rome. Cette instruction incomplète, cette fausse éducation classique était, en
somme, une médiocre préparation au métier de législateurs, si nouveau pour nos pères
de la Révolution.” M. Alfred Rambaud, <i>Histoire de la Civilisation française</i>, ii,
280. An English lady who was traveling in France writes in August, 1792: “Their
studies are chiefly confined to Rollin and Plutarch, the deistical works of Voltaire and
the visionary politics of Jean Jacques. Hence they amuse their hearers with allusions
to Cæsar and Lycurgus, the Rubicon and Thermopylæ. Hence they pretend to be
too enlightened for belief, and despise all governments not founded on the <i>contrat
social</i> or the <i>profession de foi</i>.... They talk familiarly of Sparta and Lacedemon.”

“For forty years philosophy had undermined all the parts of the foundations of despotism;
and as Rome before Cæsar was already enslaved by its vices, France before
Necker was already freed by its intelligence,” 56. In various parts of this article of
1789 he speaks of a republic as being the best suited to France. “Before the Royal
Sitting I regarded Louis XVI. with admiration, for he had some virtues, as he walked
not at all in the steps of his fathers, was not at all a despot, and had convoked the
States-General. While in the province I read in the <i>gazette</i> his beautiful speech:
‘What does it matter that my authority suffer provided my people should be happy?’
We have, I said to myself, a greater king than the Trojans, the Marcus Aurelius, the
Antonines, who did not at all limit their power. Personally I loved Louis XVI.;
but the <i>monarchy was not less odious</i>,” 60-61. “I declare then boldly for democracy,”

aroused by the escape. “L’opinion dominante était une antipathie pour les rois, un

Rue Saint-Honoré, on exigea d’un marchand le sacrifice d’une tête de plâtre, à la

<p><a id="Footnote_125" href="#FNanchor_125" class="label">[125]</a> “Il n’est pas besoin d’examiner l’abolition de la royauté. Le voeu de la nation
sans doute, est assez prononcé; sans doute ceux-mêmes qui prétendaient que les
adresses de tous les départements sur la déchéance ne suffisoient pas à l’assemblée
nationale avant le 10 août, sont à présent convaincus que les Français ne veulent ni
d’un roi de leur nation, ni d’un étranger.” Noting the weakness in the American
constitution which made it possible for one man, Washington or Adams, to acquire
too great power, the article urged that the French should imitate no country, but
should work out their own plan. However, this same number told of the first meeting
of the Convention and of the abolition of the monarchy.</p>

du courage et du patriotisme qu’ont déployé dans cette journée à jamais mémorable
les fédérés des quatre-vingt-trois départments, qui avec leurs frères d’armes de Paris,
out sauvé le patrie.” Aulard, <i>La Société des Jacobins</i>, iv, 194, 195. August 22, an
address was sent to the affiliated society pointing out what class of men should be
chosen for the Convention. If they do not choose these, a new insurrection like that
of August 10 may be necessary. <i>La Société des Jacobins</i>, iv, 233-235.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_151" href="#FNanchor_151" class="label">[151]</a> December 21, 1790, the Jacobin Club printed a list of 1,100 members; August
16, 1790, there were fifteen affiliated societies. These affiliations increased rapidly in
the spring of 1791, so that by June 16, there were 406 affiliated and 14 corresponding
societies; by June, 1793, there were a thousand affiliated clubs. Aulard, <i>La Société
des Jacobins</i>, i, Intro., xxxiii-xxxix. That these clubs knew how to make use of their
affiliations for political action is patent from the letter sent out among them, August
22, four days before the primary elections were held: “C’est à nous à le soutenir; et
nous le pouvons, en éloignant des assemblées électorales tous ceux qui ont protégé,
même indirectement la cour et le sacerdoce, les émigrés et leurs adhérents. Notre
choix ne doit pas être difficile; les patriotes font la majorité de la nation. Ils peuvent
donc, s’ils savent se réunis, faire des choix favorables à leurs intérêts. Les électeurs étant
payés à trois livres ... il n’est plus nécessaire d’être riche bourgeois, prêtre, ou ci-devant
noble pour accepter cette noble mission; et, si la majorité des électeurs est au
niveau de la révolution du 10 Août 1792 nos nouveaux députés ne tarderont pas à la
consolider et à sauver le peuple par une constitution conformé à la déclaration des
droits et à l’intérêt du plus grand nombre.” <i>Société des Jacobins</i>, iv, 233, <i>et seq.</i></p>

in a series of letters from an <i>English Lady</i>, i, 93: “If the electors and elected of the
other departments be of the same complexion with those of Arras, the new Assembly
will not, in any respect, be preferable to the old one. I have reproached many of the
people of this place, who, from their education and property, have a right to take an
interest in the public affairs, with thus suffering themselves to be represented by the
most desperate and worthless individuals of the town. Their defense is that they are
insulted and overpowered if they attend the popular meetings, and by electing <i>les
gueux et les scélérats pour députés</i>, they send them to Paris and secure their own
local tranquillity.”</p>
